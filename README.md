# NIS2-IDENTITY-SECURITY

## Introduction

This essay aims to examine the implications and scope of the NIS2 Directive (Network and Information Security Directive 2), the European regulatory framework designed to strengthen cybersecurity in critical and essential sectors. The central objective is to explore how this regulation updates and expands previous security requirements, integrating technical and operational mechanisms to mitigate risks in an increasingly interconnected digital environment, emphasizing identity security as a fundamental pillar.

Like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), NIS2 seeks to harmonize measures and approaches among EU member states to protect digital infrastructure, ensuring best practices in addressing the growing wave of cyberattacks. (Akamai)

This essay is structured based on an analysis of legal requirements, security standards, and best technical practices. By evaluating key aspects such as incident management, supply chain protection, and the implementation of proactive controls, the goal is to identify how NIS2 aims to reduce vulnerabilities in strategic sectors such as energy, transportation, health, and digital services. Additionally, the practical challenges organizations face in meeting strict incident notification deadlines, risk assessment protocols, and collaboration beyond national borders within the European continent are analyzed.


## Development

Established in 2016, the Network and Information Systems (NIS) Directive was a pioneering initiative requiring EU member states to implement security measures and incident reporting obligations in key sectors such as energy, transportation, banking, health, and digital infrastructure. Its primary goal was to ensure that essential organizations adopted robust practices to protect their networks and systems against cyber threats while fostering cross-border cooperation among countries.

NIS2 came into effect on January 16, 2023, to expand the scope of the original regulation by incorporating more sectors (such as waste management, critical product manufacturing, and postal services), strengthening compliance requirements, and addressing emerging challenges such as supply chain security and risk management.

NIS2 also emphasizes corporate responsibility and the necessity of advanced technical controls, such as MFA authentication and digital identity protection. The directive mandates the implementation of comprehensive and strict security controls to reduce risk and prevent cybersecurity breaches in systems and data. The requirements cover a wide range of IT systems and resources, including protection against ransomware, phishing, and unauthorized access. (Akamai)

ENISA (European Union Agency for Cybersecurity) published a threat landscape report warning about the increasing use of new phishing techniques and zero-day attacks targeting organizations across the EU.

Article 21 of NIS2 outlines ten fundamental security measures that organizations must implement to support four general areas. These measures follow a "comprehensive approach" aimed at mitigating the most probable threat vectors. These measures include:

1. Risk analysis policies and information system security
2. Incident response plans to address active threats
3. Business continuity plans, including backups, disaster recovery, and crisis management procedures
4. Supply chain security, including measures addressing relationships between companies and their direct suppliers or service providers
5. Security in the acquisition, development, and maintenance of networks and information systems, including vulnerability management and disclosure
6. Policies and procedures to assess the effectiveness of cybersecurity risk management measures
7. Training programs for cybersecurity awareness, hygiene, and best practices
8. Cryptography and encryption policies
9. Access control procedures, especially for employees with access to sensitive data
10. Multi-factor authentication, continuous monitoring, and secure communication systems

Identity Security is a comprehensive approach to protecting individuals, applications, and machines within an organization. It is based on the assumption that any user (human or not) can gain privileges under certain circumstances, infiltrate systems, traverse networks, and execute attacks. Identity Security mitigates risk by:
- Continuously authenticating and authorizing internal and external users according to Zero Trust principles.
- Strictly controlling access to local and cloud resources.
- Monitoring and auditing user activity rigorously, providing compliance evidence.

A comprehensive Identity Security strategy is essential to defend critical infrastructures against malicious attacks, ransomware, software supply chain vulnerabilities, and other threats. An Identity Security program can help organizations address key Article 21 requirements related to incident management and reporting, supply chain security, cryptography and encryption technologies, access control policies, and Zero Trust security.

## Conclusions

NIS2 represents a fundamental advancement in European cybersecurity. Not only does it expand the scope of its predecessor, but it also aligns with principles such as Zero Trust and proactive risk management, requiring organizations to adopt technical and operational solutions that ensure the authenticity, integrity, and traceability of digital identities.

To address identity security issues, organizations can take actions such as:

- Multi-factor authentication (MFA) and continuous verification: Implementing systems that not only validate identity upon initial access but also monitor abnormal behaviors throughout the session, using artificial intelligence to detect real-time deviations.
- Zero Trust-based access governance: Adopting the principle of "never trust, always verify," granting minimal privileges, and periodically reviewing permissions, especially for critical roles such as system administrators or external providers.
- Supply chain protection: Integrating identity controls into third-party processes, requiring security certifications and ongoing audits to prevent breaches through vulnerable suppliers.
- Advanced encryption and key management: Ensuring that credentials and sensitive data are protected using robust algorithms (such as AES-256) and stored in hardware security modules (HSMs).
- Training and awareness: Developing continuous training programs for employees, focusing on identifying phishing attacks, social engineering, or identity impersonation, aligned with NIS2 Article 21 requirements.

NIS2 is not just a legal requirement; it is an opportunity for organizations to build cybersecurity resilience. It also helps mitigate risks and strengthens their ability to innovate in a digitalized market. Cross-border collaboration, investment in technologies such as MFA or predictive AI, and adopting frameworks like Zero Trust are inevitable steps in navigating a landscape where identities—both human and machine—are the new security perimeter.
